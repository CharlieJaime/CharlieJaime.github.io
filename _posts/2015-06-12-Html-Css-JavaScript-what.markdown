There are many types of languages that are used in Front-end Development to create the foundation and functionality of a Website. However “The Skulls of Touganda”(The Phantom comic reference) in creating a site are HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Language: Purpose

HTML - Structural

CSS - Presentational

JavaScript - Behavioral

Structural

HTML or HyperText Markup Language has to maintain three main purposes in mind. One is to work with the content and give it a structure, separating headers, paragraphs etc. Secondly, doing it with the Markup part of HTML (say for headers inserted in h1 tags)

{% highlight ruby %}
	<h1>—-Header--</h1>
	<p>—paragraph content</p>
	<img src “#”/>
{% endhighlight %}

Lastly and most importantly, turning simple plain text into HyperText. In other words, “clickable” or changeable text, more commonly used to create text to links.

Presentational

CSS or Cascading Style Sheets has a diverse use in the creation of Websites. It can be used to bring your mockups to life, while adding styling, typography, or layouts to more than one page at a time.

{% highlight ruby %}
		body{
	background-image: url("");
	font: sans;
	}
{% endhighlight %}

CSS has evolved so much over the years, that it now allows you to add some small functionally or animation; before, this was only possible with JavaScript. This is possible using transitions, transforms, and actions like hover, which help shorten your JavaScript code.

Behavioral

Javascript is one of the most highly used programming languages that can give your site dynamic interactivity and functionality (for example, things like pop-ups or dynamic animations loaders). It really has come along way from its humble beginnings (which only allowed you to add small and simple interactive features). However, it has grown to become a leading programming language and is used to power the front-end of sites like those of Google Maps, Facebook, and Gmail (at times even used for backend development as a super fast web server.)
