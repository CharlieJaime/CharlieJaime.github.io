I've trained MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) for approximately 4 years now. I started my training out of curiosity because of the UFC and thanks to a personal friend of mine (thanks Marco) and also Bruce Lee, I mean its  BRUCE LEE MAN! (enough said). My friend took me to a small gym in Pasadena named “Kenpofit Martial Arts Academy” where it all started, and the rest as they say, is history. Over time I moved to various gyms, such as PKG (Punch, Kick, Grapple) Training Center and my current gym HQ Brand (formally known as “Tapout Training Center") in Downtown, LA. I have met from some of the worst to some of the best coaches in my gym transitions. However, there are only been three coaches that have truly affected how I train (physically/emotionally) and my overall view on marital arts: Ian Harris, James Parker, and Deon Montgomery (don’t mind the order, it is not a ranking). This week I had the chance to conduct a short interview with one of the three wise men, Muay Thai/ Boxing Coach James Parker a.k.a "James Poidog”. Here is a brief interview discussing overall coaching, styles, students, mental aspects of a great Muay Thai mind.

	<li>What made you go into coaching?</li>

	"I got into coaching kind of by accident, like in training partners at one point in my life, I had to teach some friends enough to be able to continue training. I was just working so much I couldn't get time to train in a proper gym. I found on many levels I really enjoyed helping people. Seeing someone succeed at something that challenges them just thrills me. Being a part of that is more fulfilling than if I were to do it myself.”

	<li>To you, what is a coach supposed to be to his/her students?</li> 

	“A mentor. And uncle type. Someone you respect and has your best interest at heart even when you might not agree with their point of view."

	<li>What you think about adding modern katas to MMA?</li>

	“Not sure how I feel honestly. If for some reason katas were invented and implemented, then of course, with some modification there's a place for them. The problem might be that their uses might be corrupted to make some people money at the expense of the original reason. That would have to change.”

	<li>As for sparring, do you believe gear should be used, and if so, and how hard should teammates go at each other?</li> 

	"I think at some points in training sparring has to be a test that will determine how you’ll do in a fight. It's the closest thing in training to an actual fight. The problem comes when a person can't do anything but go a hundred percent and risk injury every time. Not every fight is a hundred percent and neither should every training session. Trying new things to evolve your game means there will be a period in which you probably won't be any good, but you still need to attempt it live. If you get smashed every time you try something new, at what point do you stop trying new things?"

	<li>Do you believe that a coach should work around a students' style of fighting or mold him into a more adaptable student?</li>

	"I think it's a combination, BUT the end of the day a student comes to learn from the coach, so the percentage should be higher that the student adapts to the coach than the other way around. A lot of times that means frustration for the students’ part, but I can be frustrated too, waking up sore frustrating and skill coming to teach a students thats rough around the edges. If you can't handle and overcome frustration, then maybe fighting isn't for you."

	<li>What tips would you give beginners or advanced fighters?</li>

	“For both beginners and advanced, be persistent and consistent; nothing good comes right away. Being persistent means that you won't have any choice but to get better. Our bodies and minds are amazing adaptive machines if we give them enough time and stimulus."

	<li>How do you personally decide when a student is ready for a bout?</li>

	“That's a tough one...I'm still working on it. In Thailand they put people to fight almost immediately, within 4 months of training. Shoot, even kids fight. I personally know a few guys that fought 5 times in a month when they were younger. The belief is you learn more in competition than when you train in the gym. The problem is... I'm in America (lol). This ain't Thailand. Guys in Thailand train 6 days a week, twice a day, for hours on end. How do I decide? A combination of factors, ranging from the students work ethic, attitude, skills and my generosity of opinion on those things will vary on any given day.”

	<li>What is the one single trait a coach should have for successful coaching?</li> 

	"I believe it needs to be patience but also adaptability. Patience is my biggest challenge, the skill I work on constantly as I feel I suck at it lol. But its an ability than can be work on, because if a rigid instructor can't change or evolve to be a better instructor, so how can he or she then inspire change in their students?”

	<li>What do you think is the biggest mistake coaches make when teaching?</li> 

	“Thinking their way is THE way. It's that rigidity again. You MUST believe in yourself, but not being open to the mistakes you make is fatal."

	<li>What is your coaching philosophy?</li> 

	"HA! That's too broad a question for me to answer. I don't just have one."

	<li>What do you think separates the successful fighters from the rest?</li> 

	“If you're talking in the fight, that I would say hard, correct work in training. Having the attitude that nothing else is worth more than that win; not the size, record, demeanor of your opponent. Nothing. That might also apply to the fighters that are successful outside the ring/ cage too. To change when it comes to family, lifestyle, etc.”

Hope that this interview with James Parker gives you a more insightful look into the world of martial art coaching. Most of all, I hope it gives you inspiration to modify your coaching style. As for students’ I hope it changes your approach to training to continue to improve that bond between coach and fighter. With that said keep working hard at everything you do, you might just become the next Muhammad Ali, Anderson Silva, Freddie Roach, or Greg Jackson.
