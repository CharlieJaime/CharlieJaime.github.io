(Note: This is for the self-starter)

You wanted to learn and become a Ruby on Rails Developer. Ruby on Rails is one of the easiest frameworks to work with (in my personal opinion) and it simply gets easier with repetition and practice. So without further a due, this is my personal guide to becoming proficient with Ruby on Rails.

Beginning your Rails Journey

I strongly recommend that you start your learning with codecademy’s free courses in this sequence. This will give you a strong base on the basics of front-end development; HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript(jQuery) interactivity.

1) <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web">HTML & CSS</a><br>
2) <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript">JavaScript</a><br>
3) <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/jquery">jQuery</a>

Once you are done with this particular set you should  definitely take on the core language of Ruby on Rails. This will facilitate your transition to Rails framework and its Object Oriented Programming.

4) <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby">Ruby</a>

Now on to the main courses. This set will teach you the main source of back-end development with ruby. It will teach you CRUD (Create, Read, Update, & Delete) functions with ease, while also adding authentication for Users or Admins.Finally, mySQL teaches you the importance of saving and manipulating data.

6) <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/rails-auth">Ruby on Rails(Authentication)</a><br>
7) <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql">SQL</a>

One course I truly recommend after finishing this sequence of courses would be Yonathan Ayenew ’s “Ruby on Rails in 3 Weeks — Build Evernote, Pinterest and Wordpress” on Skillshare. This course will help solidify some of the core concepts learned from Codecademy’s course. This will be accomplished by re-creating web applications that are popular today by giving you a good sense of how everything is put together.
