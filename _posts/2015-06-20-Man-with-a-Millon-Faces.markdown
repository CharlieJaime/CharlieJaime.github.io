I would like to say I have a great anecdote, or some quote on a fatherly advice that I live by that has made me the man I am today, but sometimes when you grow up in a broken home you don’t get that luxury. I then sought for guides to become a man elsewhere. I got bits and pieces around the local gang members, drug dealers, gym coaches, and soccer coaches, but one source reigned supreme. The small (and?) silver screen media (from characters to quotes), molded my persona and keeps doing so today. Because this list is extensive, I will only be discussing a few movies and t.v. shows that have impacted me the most.

<ul>
	<strong>Godfather/ Godfather II</strong>
	<li>"Don’t make promises you can’t keep.”- I learned your word is your bond and you should break it for no one. It shows your true character and your trustworthiness. </li>
	<li>"Family is the most important thing in life.”- I am very family oriented, and no matter how messed up things get between us, I will always be there till death.</li>
	<li>"Don’t act on emotion."- It has happened to me before, where I have said or done something out of anger and regretted it later. Now, no matter my emotional state, I try to see things subjectively. </li>
	<li>"It’s not personal, its business.”- This is very similar to keeping your word. However, money changes people. So when dealing with money, no matter your relationship with the opposite party it (should?) get dealt as business. I also see a lot of myself in Michael Corleone; me being the youngest in my family, taking my own route of life, and slowly but surely taking the family reigns. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<strong>Fight Club</strong>
	<li>"No fear. No distractions. The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.”- Everyone has that inner voice that tells you not to do something because you might get judged or fail. I’ve learned to let go of that voice more, and stay disciplined focusing on what truly gets me to where I want to be. </li>
	<li>"It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything.”- This is similar to the previous quote, but I personally feel it’s much different. I believe it speaks of the moment when you have completely hit rock bottom, which I have. This is when you truly have all the room you want in order to change, your personal Tyler Durden (of course, not that crazy). </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<strong>Riddick Movies</strong>
	<li> "I bow to no man.”- Never let someone put you down just because they think they are superior in any way shape or form. If you can, try to teach them a lesson and humble them a bit. </li>
	<li>"It’s an animal thing.”- Sometimes your most basics instincts help - go with them. This applies more to me, since I am a MMA practitioner, so this is best used in fights its where it counts or in the streets.</li>
	<li>"Lesson Learned. No such word as ‘friend’.”- I do believe in friends but sometimes you can never be too careful/aware of the people you are dealing with. </li>
	<li>"You’re not afraid of the dark, are you?”- This one just sounds cool! </li>
	<li>Richard B Riddick: Even though he is a murderer and an escaped convict, his manly demeanor and self-reliance really struck a cord with me; he is someone I wanted to be like. </li>
</ul>  

<ul>
	<strong>Hannibal Lecter Movies and Series</strong>
	<li>"People don’t always tell you what they are thinking. They just see to it that you don’t advance in life.”- You have to know that not everyone will like you some people just want to see you fail. Try to prove yourself right with actions. </li>
	<li>"Now you’re being rude, I hate rude people.”- Manners maketh man. Simply knowing how to carry yourself around people can take you a long way. Putting aside his sociopathic ways, Hannibal Lecter was also a great guidance. His ability to simply walk into a room and obtain presence and acknowledgement is very gentleman-like. Also, being well educated is key to move forward.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<strong>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Series</strong>
	<li>Will’s character also left a good impression on me. He taught me to dress to impress (“it’s got to be a sin to look this good!”). He also taught me to truly express your goofy child self, dance at a moments notice or stick to a silly joke with no worries. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<strong>Sons Of Anarchy Series</strong>
	<li>There were many characters and quotes from this show that either taught me something or just reminded me of things I learned before. One new thing however, was to write things down. Not just your about life but your thoughts on it and how it changed you. Some other things I was reminded of were that a bond between a mother and her child (children) can be very strong. Also, (as I have experienced in LA) law enforcement can be as corrupt as the criminals they pursue. Last but not least, learn from your and others’ past; you don’t want to repeat the same mistakes and keep the cycle going. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<strong>Bruce Lee Movies</strong>
	<li>"The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering”- I want to leave a mark in this life before I leave. A legacy to change people’s lives for the better.</li>
	<li> “I wish neither to possess nor to be possessed.
	I no longer covet paradise. 
	More important, I no longer fear hell… 
	The medicine for my suffering I had within me from the very beginning, but I did not take it.
	My ailment came from within myself, but I did not observe it. 
	Until this moment
	Now I see that I will never find the light unless, like the candle, I am my own fuel. 
	Consuming myself.”- I have suffered with depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies most of my life. However, I became my own victim and lost my purpose in life. I’ve come to learn that YOU give your life meaning, YOU are your state of mind. Always keep moving forward.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<strong>A Knight’s Tale</strong>
	<li>"A man can change his stars.”- No matter your upbringing, a person can change for the better and go out to get what he/she is worth. William Thatcher represents this perfectly and he gave me the strength to go out into the world and pursue what I’m worth. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<strong>Batman Movies and Series</strong>
	<li>As crazy as the joker may be, I’ve learned a couple of good things from him. One of them was that being prepared doesn’t necessarily mean having a plan. Something plans simply just don’t workout so just be ready for everything, you never know what might happen. Also, stand up for yourself because some people are only as good as you allow them to be. Meaning if they see you can be taken advantage of, they will do so. Lastly, “Awareness is the most precious kind of freedom”, being aware of not only yourself but your surrounding gives you great power to change things……..OH and never stop having fun HAHAHAHAHAHahahahaha</li>
	<li>Batman is just awesome. He gave me countless things to live by. For example, sometimes you just need to be the hero people need, whether they think you’re the evil one or hero, as long as you’re doing it for the right reason. I also learned that knowledge is power, so give and share knowledge freely, don’t stop other people from improving. And no matter how fucked up things might seem, humanity (People) deserve to be saved. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<strong>The Flash Movies and Series</strong>
	<li>The comic relief of DC comics - the one, the only, Barry Allen a.k.a the fastest man alive. I see myself in him because of his wit and funny banter. But one thing that I aspire to have, is to one day have his trademark trait - an unwavering optimism (I’m getting there!).</li>
</ul>

All of these things from the small and silver screen characters and quotes have taught me. They have molded me into the man I am (and am still becoming) today, and I’m glad for it. I’m slowly becoming a gentleman of olden times, but with a modern twist; one that evolves with time, has that alpha male presence, yet is understanding, self aware, and gentle.
