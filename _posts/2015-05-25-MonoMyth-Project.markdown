Reading and writing has never been my strong suit for as long as I can remember. It became more of a personal vendetta to actually improve upon these skills, which at times didn’t seem improvable after countless years of stuttering while reading out loud or writing incohesive/scattered thoughts. Having improved considerably over time, I decided to take on a challenge to help me accomplish both a life goal and test both my reading and writing skills simultaneously. I’ve always wanted to write a book; a perfect platform for creativity and for refining skills that I would like to take to the next level. Also simply, how many people would like to write a book but never actually do it?

As I was watching a TED-Ed called “What Makes a Hero?” by Matthew Winkler

I got the idea for my book. The video discusses how most literary heroes were and are still created today using the same old age MonoMyth Template or “Hero’s Journey”.

Worlds:


*Ordinary World-The hero’s current living place and starting point.

*Special World-The world were the hero will go through his/her life changing experience 

Cycle Stages:

1.Status Quo-The hero’s current state of life in the Ordinary World.


2.Call to Adventure-The hero’s call to he adventure whether at random or preordained destiny.
 

3.Assistance-The hero receives some sort of help.

4.Departure-The hero finally departs to the Special World.

5.Trails-The hero goes through small trials.

6.Approach- The hero finally gets to his biggest and final test.

7.Crisis-In which he/she suffers a great crisis by failing or dying but eventually overcomes all odds and wins. 

8.Treasure- The hero finally gets what he was seeking or wanted/needed to accomplish. 

9.Result- The hero sees the results of gaining treasure (ex. End a war, defeating his main rival etc.)

10.Return- The hero returns home to the Ordinary World
 

11.New Life- The hero comes into his own and new life.

12.Resolution-all unsolved ties are cleared, and the hero returns to status quo but with more prosperous and enlightened state.

Once I watched this, it gave me the idea to write a book about my life heavily influenced by and using the Monomyth template, but not with the intent of creating a fictional hero. However, recalling my life as I remember it can at times can be difficult due to certain events, yet the happy moments tend to triumph overall. Another thing that has proven to be difficult is finding a clear direction of incorporating my life into each stage of the cycle while staying true to the MonoMyth literature, not just simply writing biographically. But I will do what I always do, start writing and keep on writing till’ I find that clear vision for my book and fix my mistakes along the way.
