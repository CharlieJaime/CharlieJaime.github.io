In my early youth, I was one of the best procrastination criminals known to man. I would rudimentarily prep my task in hand, work on it for a short period, and never touch it again. Unless, it was do the next day or resulted in a short term gain. As I got older I understood that approaching my daily tasks and life goals in this fashion will inevitably take no where or YEARS to accomplish my ambitious plans. So unconsciously I started to develop habitual routines that still help me get shit done.


Get Shit Done Tips:

• <strong>Small single focus</strong>

Break overall task into smaller digestible bits. This will give you two important outcomes. First, you will be giving a higher focus to a smaller task which will build up and improve your overall quality work. Second, when finishing most tasks the emotional reward is always great. Now, since you have smaller tasks that means more short term rewards which undoubtably will keep you motivated longer while working on the entire task.

• <strong>Avoid divided attention</strong>

This is quite simple don’t multitask. Its scientific proven that are attention span has decreased over the years. So now imagine if you add youtube, twitter, texting to the mix, result: crappy work with shitty outcomes. Stay focus and diligent.

• Consistency</strong>

The creator of habits is consistency. Repeat, repeat, and repeat some more, this might seem mundane, however, dedicated habits make even the hardest task seem like child’s play.

• <strong>No BS degree</strong>

I personally had a Ph.D in bullshitting myself all the time. I would always have an excuse for why would didn’t get something done or why I didn’t achieve my goal. My excuses would range from growing up in a broke home, financial problems, blaming someone else but life handed my ass to me and it was time to reflect. I truly and honestly weighed the things in my life that I could change, things I have no control over and the things that really kept me from succeeding. So take some time and put things in perspective and don’t earn your degree in Bullshitting.

• <strong>Limit distractions</strong>

Along with limiting your social media time while you should be working, limiting your social outings is just as important. If you know you have work to do on Friday night don’t go and party, sit your butt down and grind out the work. This will save you from a stressful hung over workload the next day. Try to work your leisure time around your work schedule not the other way around.

• <strong>Carry your own wait</strong>

This pertains to working with other people or in a group project. Always get your assigned task done, don’t sandbag the team, that just gives you a bad reputation. So hard work and if your done early with allow yourself to help others go beyond what’s being asked from you and stand out.

• <strong>Network</strong>

Networking can be a crucial part in getting something done and its an area in which I’m still improving. There will be a time when your have a task you don’t necessarily have the skills for. This is when knowing people who are in par or better than your comes in handy. However this doesn’t mean pass on your work to someone else that would be pointless. Here is where you should take the time to learn a new skills, procedure, good practices, etc. from some that could help your career and the same should work vice versa.

So take these routines/tips into consideration on your next workload, project or what ever it may be and remember, GET SHIT DONE.
