Welcome to charliejaime.github,io,

Where free expression is key.
Once you have entered my site the most essential tab will be Portfolio, were I display multiple web development projects I've worked on over the years.
Second, will be my about me page giving you, "the viewer", a better since of my background.
Last but certainly no least, my Blog page, where I will post weekly articles is reserved for a Web Development topic but occasionally the topic will vary.
