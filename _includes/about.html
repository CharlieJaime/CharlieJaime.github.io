      <indent>My real name is Charlie Jaime, I’m a young Web Designer/Developer with an entrepreneurship mentality and drive.</indent> Im currently building my personal brand within the tech industry while simultaneously working on future endeavors, mainly creating, run, and maintaining a successful tech startup. Which will take a lot of handwork and dedication, but all great minds need small breaks. I have a great affinity for comics, drawing comic art, mixed martial arts training, soccer, and as you can see cheesy pepperoni pizza…COWABUNGA!!!! However, my great passion is Web Development, I specialize in HTML5, CSS/SASS, JavaScript(&jQuery Library), Ruby/Ruby on Rails(PostgreSQL Database), and Jekyll static sites. Im in the process of learning Node.js, Gulp.js, Angular.js., and Express.js to name a few. I also dabble in Wed Design, I mainly use Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Sketchbook Pro and Wacom tablet to produce logos, page assets, and sample wireframes.
